# **Data model adaptations**

The list below indicates all changes and differences compared to DCAT-AP 2.1.1. The impact of the alignment with W3C DCAT 3 is provided below.

- DCAT-AP 2.1.1 has no notion of definition and usage notes. Splitted the existing descriptive texts in definitions and usage nodes according to the SEMIC best practices for definitions as advised by the [SEMIC Style Guide](https://semiceu.github.io/style-guide/1.0.0/index.html).
- Added a direct link to the W3C specification for classes and properties that are explictly mentioned in DCAT 3 to indicate the relation of a property with W3C DCAT in a more precise way. Where appropriate we aligned the definitions and usage notes. (issue [128](https://github.com/SEMICeu/dcat-ap/issues/128), [135](https://github.com/SEMICeu/dcat-ap/issues/135), [179](https://github.com/SEMICeu/dcat-ap/issues/179))
- Reorganised the Application Profile in Main Entities, Supportive Entities and Datatypes in order to enhance the readibility.
- Added the classes Dataset Series to reflect the new notions in DCAT 3.
- The notion Dataset member of a Dataset Series which was present during the first Candidate Recommendation has been removed.
- Applied the deprecation by replacing the mapping to the URIs for the impacted properties.
- Integrated DCAT-AP HVD specific aspects as general approach in DCAT-AP so that this is available for other profiles.

# **Alignment with W3C DCAT 3**

## **Dataset Series**

Dataset Series are the main change for DCAT 2 to DCAT 3.

DCAT-AP 3.0.0 has adopted Dataset Series in a lightweight alignment: namely very few restrictions have been included. Nevertheless the Working Group discussed extensively the potential to add additional constraints and usage conditions. Given the wide variation of possible usages, the Working Group decided to go forward with a lightweight alignment as first step. The reflections are summarised as general usage guidelines (section 14.2) for Dataset Series so that implementers and other users have a common basis to start from.

As a consequence of the discussion, this resulted in a major editorial revision compared to the June 2023 Candidate release of DCAT-AP 3.0.0.  
The supporting class Dataset Member of Dataset Series has been removed, because no additional constraints are being set on datasets which are a member of a Dataset Series collection. Consequently also the properties that were associated with this supporting class are removed and not included in DCAT-AP. Users that want to use them can still do in line with the approach on extending [DCAT-AP](https://semiceu.github.io/uri.semic.eu-generated/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.0/#specoverviewr).

Various aspects of this alignment have been discussed in the issues [155](https://github.com/SEMICeu/dcat-ap/issues/155), [239](https://github.com/SEMICeu/dcat-ap/issues/239), [240](https://github.com/SEMICeu/dcat-ap/issues/240), [249](https://github.com/SEMICeu/dcat-ap/issues/249), [289](https://github.com/SEMICeu/dcat-ap/issues/289), [296](https://github.com/SEMICeu/dcat-ap/issues/296), [278](https://github.com/SEMICeu/dcat-ap/issues/278), [277](https://github.com/SEMICeu/dcat-ap/issues/277), [276](https://github.com/SEMICeu/dcat-ap/issues/276), [275](https://github.com/SEMICeu/dcat-ap/issues/275). The Working Group did an attempt to categorise different cases of Dataset Series and tried to give them a unique name (identified with dct:type). That work did not resulted in a clear path forward, ready to be included in DCAT-AP.

- issue [48](https://github.com/SEMICeu/dcat-ap/issues/48): provide a shacl file with unique identifiers for each constraint.
