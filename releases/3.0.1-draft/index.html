<section id="abstract">
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
DCAT-AP is a DCAT profile for sharing information about Catalogues containing Datasets and Data Services descriptions in Europe, under maintenance by the SEMIC action, Interoperable Europe.
<p/>
This Application Profile provides a minimal common basis within Europe to share Datasets and Data Services cross-border and cross-domain.
</section>


<section id="specintro">
    <h2>
        Introduction
    </h2>
    
<h3>Context</h3>

Around 2010, on behalf of the European Commission the access to public sector information was studied. These studies showed that businesses and citizens faced many difficulties in finding and reusing public sector information. 
The studies indicated that the availability of the information in a machine-readable format as well as a thin layer of commonly agreed metadata could facilitate data cross-reference and interoperability and therefore considerably enhance its value for reuse.
Therefore, to overcome these hurdles, the European Commission invested in policies [[PSI]], data interoperability [[SEMIC]]  and infrastructure [[DEU]]. 

<p/>
Interoperable Europe, within its mission to stimulate the data interoperability in Europe, manages this specification on the metadata agreements for sharing dataset descriptions between data portals. 
The governance is taken care by the SEMIC action within Interoperable Europe. 
Initially, the scope of the specification was the exchange between Open Data Portals in Europa.
Although this is still at the core of the specification, DCAT-AP is not limited to public accessible Open Data, but can be applied to any kind of datasets.
In the past decade, DCAT-AP has grown from a single specification to a whole ecosystem of related and interconnected specifications.





<h3>Scope of the Application Profile</h3>
<p>
The Application Profile specified in this document is based on the specification of the Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) [[vocab-dcat-3]] developed under the responsibility of the [[[DXWG]]] (DXWG) at W3C. 
</p><p>
The objective of this work is to produce a profile of DCAT based on numerous requests for change coming from real-world implementations of the specification listed on GitHub since the previous release. For that the DCAT specification is extended with improved definitions, usage notes and usages constraints such as cardinalities for properties and the usage of controlled vocabularies.  Additional classes and properties from other well-known vocabularies are re-used where necessary.
</p><p>
The work does not cover implementation issues like mechanisms for exchange of data and expected behaviour of systems implementing the Application Profile other than what is defined in the Conformance Statement in section [[[#conformance]]].
The section [[[#validation-of-dcat-ap]]] provides SHACL templates and references to the Interoperability Testbed tool for validating a catalogue for compliance with DCAT-AP.
</p><p>
The Application Profile is intended to facilitate data exchange and therefore the classes and properties defined in this document are only relevant for the data to be exchanged; there are no requirements for communicating systems to implement specific technical environments. The only requirement is that the systems can export and import data in RDF in conformance with this Application Profile.
</p>

<p>
As mentioned in the context, the prime objective of the Application Profile is to enhance data findability and promote reusability. 
To achieve this goal, datasets should be coherently documented. 
To enable this, the Application Profile considers several essential aspects, including among others:
<ul>
	<li>Understanding the data or service structure, and how to get access to the data</li>
	<li>Information on scope or purpose of the data</li>
	<li>Legal information</li>
	<li>Knowledge on data publishers, and any other agents involved</li>
	<li>Knowledge of data availability and change policies</li>
</ul>
These are addressed with the aim to facilitate effective data reuse, allowing users to locate, understand and utilise the available data resources more efficiently.
</p>

<h3>Revision history</h3>
The first DCAT-AP specification was released in September 2013. The subsequent releases 1.1, 1.2 and 1.2.1 improved the specification. These specifications are in line with the first release of the W3C DCAT 1 recommendation [[vocab-dcat-1]]. They express DCAT-AP in terms of Catalogue, Datasets and Distributions.
With the adoption of the W3C DCAT 2 recommendation [[vocab-dcat-2]], an alignment process for DCAT-AP was initiated. This resulted in a new release DCAT-AP 2.0.0.
The years after this specification was further elaborated in new release 2.0.1, 2.1.0 and 2.1.1.
W3C DCAT 2 restructured DCAT by introducing the notions of a generic Catalogued Resource of which Datasets and Data Services are special cases.
In 2023, the adoption of W3C DCAT 3 [[vocab-dcat-3]] triggered a new alignment for DCAT-AP.
W3C DCAT 3 extends the profile with the Dataset Series notion.
In the release <a href="">DCAT-AP 3.0</a> the alignment was made together with a number of community requests. 
More information on the alignment and the applied changes in that context are found in that document.
<p/>
This release addresses identified bugfixes and issues that have been identified.

<!--
DCAT is an RDF vocabulary designed to facilitate interoperability between data catalogues published on the Web. 

<p>
This document has been prepared in the context of Action 1.1 – Improving semantic interoperability in European eGovernment systems  of the European Commission’s Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations (ISA) programme [[ISA]].
</p><p>
</p><p>
Much of the public sector information that would benefit from interoperability is published as datasets in data portals. Therefore, an agreement on a common format for data exchange would support the sharing, discovery and re-use of this data.
</p><p>
This document is the result of the major semantic change release process described in the Change and Release Management Policy for DCAT-AP  and was built starting from DCAT-AP version 1.2.1 [[dcat-ap-20190528]].

<ul>
<li>Provide a description of the Catalogue, including at least the mandatory properties specified for the class <a href="#Catalogue">Catalogue</a>.</li>
<li>Provide information for the mandatory properties for <a href="#CatalogueRecord">Catalogue Records</a>, if descriptions of Catalogue Records are provided – please note that the provision of descriptions of Catalogue Records is optional.</li>
<li>Provide descriptions of Datasets in the Catalogue, including at least the mandatory properties for the class <a href="#Dataset">Dataset</a>.</li>
<li>Provide descriptions of Distributions, if any, of Datasets in the Catalogue, including at least the mandatory properties for the class <a href="#Distribution">Distribution</a>.</li>

<li>Provide descriptions of Data Services, if any, of Datasets in the Catalogue, including at least the mandatory properties for the class <a href="#DataService">Data Service</a>.</li>

<li>Apply the publication requirements for the controlled vocabularies as mentioned in section [[[#controlled-vocs]]]. </li>
</ul>

For the properties listed in the table in section [[[#controlled-vocs]]], the associated controlled vocabularies MUST be used. Additional controlled vocabularies MAY be used.
In addition to the mandatory properties, any of the recommended and optional properties defined in section [[[#quick-reference]]] MAY be provided.
<h3>Receiver requirements</h3>
In order to conform to this Application Profile, an application that receives metadata MUST be able to:
<li>Process information for all classes and properties specified in section [[[#quick-reference]]].</li>
<li>Process information for all controlled vocabularies specified in section [[[#controlled-vocs]]].</li>
"Processing" means that receivers must accept incoming data and transparently provide these data to applications and services. 
It does neither imply nor prescribe what applications and services finally do with the data (parse, convert, store, make searchable, display to users, etc.).

<section id="specterminology">
    <h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>
An <strong>Application Profile</strong> is a specification that reuses terms from one or more base standards, adding more specificity by identifying mandatory, recommended and optional elements to be used for a particular application, as well as recommendations for controlled vocabularies to be used. 
Application refers to the usage context of the specification. It may be abstract, for instance covering a data theme such as mobility data, but also it may refer to specific tools like open data portals. 
For DCAT-AP the usage scope is broad and in the first place taking into account the European legal context. 
</p><p>
A <strong>Dataset</strong> is a collection of data, published or curated by a single source, and available for access or download in one or more formats.
A <strong>Data Portal</strong> is a Web-based system that contains a data catalogue with descriptions of datasets and provides services enabling discovery and reuse of the datasets.

<section id="specoverview">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    
<p>
DCAT-AP is a DCAT profile for sharing information about Catalogues containing Datasets and Data Services descriptions in Europe. The core classes of the Application Profile are thus the classes Catalogue, Dataset, Distribution and Data Service. DCAT-AP allows Catalogues of only Datasets, but also Catalogues of only Data Services, but usually it will be a mixture of both. Dataset Series are introduced to further organise the Datasets within a Catalogue. 
</p><p>
The properties of the core classes may enforce the existence of other classes. One such important class is the class Agent. However in contrast to the core classes, DCAT-AP leaves a lot of freedom to the implementors to shape them to their needs. Only minimal expectations are expressed by DCAT-AP.
</p><p>
Elaborated statements about the expectations are found in section [[[#conformance]]] describing DCAT-AP conformance.
</p><p>
To improve the coherency between shared Dataset, Distribution and Data Service, section [[[#usage-guide-on-datasets-distributions-and-data-services]]] provides additional guidelines.

</p><p>
The list of included properties contains a selection of the properties from the W3C DCAT 3 specification [[vocab-dcat-3]]  on which DCAT-AP expresses additional constraints or on which DCAT-AP wants to emphasise their usage. Any property that is mentioned in DCAT applicable to a class but not explicitly is listed DCAT-AP is considered an optional field for DCAT-AP for that class. It means that for these properties DCAT-AP has no use cases that require additional usage considerations beyond ‘use the property as DCAT specifies’.
Properties that are not explicitly listed in this specification have no conformance expectation. 
From that perspective these are ignored.  DCAT-AP acts in this way as a filter for all the possibilities DCAT offers.  
Nevertheless, to keep DCAT-AP concise and to the point optional DCAT-AP properties that have no additional usage notes to DCAT may become subject for removal if the usage in the practice is sporadic.  
</p>

<h3>Application profile diagram</h3>

An overview of DCAT-AP is shown by the UML diagram below. The UML diagram illustrates the specification described in this document. For readability purposes, the representation has been condensed as follows:
<ul>
<li> No ranges for data properties are shown, because some of them are expressed as unions of XSD types</li>
<li> The figure contain the key classes with some important supporting classes. Other object properties (relationships) are listed as properties on the UML class with their target range.</li>
<li> The class dcat:Resource has been included to ease to see the connection with W3C DCAT. DCAT-AP treats it as an abstract notion. </li>

<h2>
   Main Entities
</h2>
<p>
The main entities are those that form the core of the Application Profile. 
The properties and their associated constraints that apply in the context of this profile are listed in a tabular form.
Each row corresponds to one property. 
In addition to the constraints also cross-references are provided to DCAT. To save space, the following abbreviations are used to indicate in short the difference with DCAT:
<ul id="reuse-column">
	<li>A: reused as-is defined and expressed in DCAT [[vocab-dcat-3]]</li>
	<li>E: reused with additional usage notes or additional restrictions compared to DCAT [[vocab-dcat-3]]</li>
	<li>P: DCAT-AP profile specific extension where DCAT had no requirements earlier on specified</li>
</ul>
This reuse qualification assessement is with respect to a specific version of DCAT. 
Therefore it may vary over time when new versions of DCAT-AP are created.

  <h2>Controlled Vocabularies</h2>

<h3>Requirements for controlled vocabularies</h3>
The following is a list of requirements that were identified for the controlled vocabularies to be recommended in this Application Profile.
Controlled vocabularies SHOULD:
<ul>
<li>Be published under an open licence.</li>
<li>Be operated and/or maintained by an institution of the European Union, by a recognised standards organisation or another trusted organisation.</li>
<li>Be properly documented.</li>
<li>Have labels in multiple languages, ideally in all official languages of the European Union.</li>
<li>Contain a relatively small number of terms (e.g. 10-25) that are general enough to enable a wide range of resources to be classified.</li>
<li>Have terms that are identified by URIs with each URI resolving to documentation about the term.</li>
<li>Have associated persistence and versioning policies.</li>
</ul>
These criteria do not intend to define a set of requirements for controlled vocabularies in general; they are only intended to be used for the selection of the controlled vocabularies that are proposed for this Application Profile.

<h3>Expected usage of controlled vocabularies</h3>

To increase the interoperability, the value spaces of properties can be further harmonised using shared controlled vocabularies.
This kind of restriction may be subject to a varying interpretation on what the expected usage of a controlled vocabulary is.
To ensure a common interpretation the following expectations are defined:

<ul>
<li id="cv-a"> The property MUST use as range values codes from {codelist} <br/>
This expectation results in that the value space is closed under the codelist. 
Validation systems SHOULD produce errors.
All profiles in the ecosystem MUST avoid conflicts by creating subproperties.

</li>
<li id="cv-b"> The property MUST have at least one value from {codelist} <br/>
This expectation makes the value space minimally constrained.
Validation systems SHOULD produce warnings.
All profiles in the ecosystem MUST adopt this interpretation in case they want to restrict the value space.
Adopting the former expectation will lead to cross-profile interpretations challenges.

</li>
<li id="cv-c"> The property IS RECOMMENDED to use as range values codes from {codelist} <br/>
The value space is closed under the codelist, but other values are tolerated. 
Recommending means expressing a strong preference. 
To make this stronger direction towards harmonisation visible in the data exchanges, validation systems SHOULD produce warnings.

</li>
<li id="cv-d">The property MAY use as range values codes from {codelist} <br/>
The value space is closed under the codelist, but other values are accepted.
This expectation is more a hint to be used. 
As there is no obligation nor strongly suggestion expressed here, the use of other codelists is valid is all cases.
Therefore validation systems MAY produce warnings but users are free to ignore them.
No validation in this case is also acceptable.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The first two (and preferably also the others) SHOULD only be used for requirements that can be verified by a machine.
If the validation can only be realised with the involvement of humans, then a less strong requirement (RECOMMMENDED or MAY) is used, 
even if the intention is to be very strict.
This is to ensure that the provided SHACL representations correspond closely to all use cases possible. 
Stronger enforcements are left for implementations as they have control on actual data exchange.
</p>

<h3>Other controlled vocabularies</h3>
In addition to the proposed common controlled vocabularies, which are mandatory to ensure minimal interoperability, implementers are encouraged to publish and to use further region or domain-specific vocabularies that are available online. While those may not be recognised by general implementations of the Application Profile, they may serve to increase interoperability across applications in the same region or domain. Examples are the full set of concepts in <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies/dataset/-/resource?uri=http://publications.europa.eu/resource/dataset/eurovoc">EuroVoc</a>, <a href="https://dspacecris.eurocris.org/">the CERIF standard vocabularies</a>, <a href="http://www.oclc.org/content/dam/oclc/dewey/versions/print/intro.pdf">the Dewey Decimal Classification</a> and numerous other schemes.

  <h2>Legal information</h2>

<p>

Providing correct and sufficient legal information is important to create trust by candidate reusers.
Without explicit legal information there is a risk involved in the reuse of data, because one has no way of knowing what is allowed. 
While in the past legislation and initiatives such as Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable [[FAIR]] data stress the importance of this information, 
recent legislations, such as the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2023/138/oj">High Value Datasets regulation</a>, have become more demanding by imposing a minimum level of reuse.
As a general principle, it is recommended that publishers consult their legal services to provide the appropriate values.

<p></p>
Within DCAT-AP properties licence, rights and access rights are used to share this information. 
The basic guidelines for their usage are expressed in the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/dcat/#license-rights">License and Rights statements</a> guideline in DCAT.
DCAT-AP implementers SHOULD consult these, in addition with the additional advices for the DCAT-AP usage context provided in this section.

<p></p>

The general principle is that licences, rights and access rights are expressions in the context of a legislation. 
It is possible (and allowed) that a EU Member State prescribes specific licences to be used for data published by the public sector.
And thus, publishers of that EU Member State will use that in the metadata descriptions.
This diversity can be considered a hurdle for cross-border reuse, as the implications of the licence might not be understood by users from another EU Member State.

<p></p>
This creates a natural tendency to use licences (or rights) which have a wider adoption than national legislation.
Unless restricted by national legislation, implementers are encouraged for that reason to use widely recognised licences such as Creative Commons licences.
In particular it is advised for [[FAIR]] data to consider CC BY 4.0 (the minimum limit set by the HVD implementing regulation) or more permissive such as licences CC Zero.

<p></p>

An assessment of data.europa.eu [[DEU]] in 2023 showed that there are different representations to indicate the same licence.
To create a more harmonised experience throughout Europe, it is recommended to use the <a href="https://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/licence">NAL licence</a>
maintained by the Publications Office if allowed by national legislation.
If local representations are used, then the equivalence with a licence in this NAL should be provided.
This mapping is expressed as metadata to local representation.
Note that this mapping is not determining the reuse conditions; the legal binding reuse conditions are those that are directly associated with the Distribution or Data Service.
Nevertheless, by applying this recommendation, it is possible for a cross-border reuser to get an insight in the reuse conditions without a detailed understanding the local legislation.

<p></p>
To encourage publishers to provide legal information DCAT-AP recommends to provide licence information. 
However, in some EU Member States, the term licence has a specific interpretation; in that interpretation the to-be provided legal information cannot be supplied as a document for property <a href="https://semiceu.github.io/uri.semic.eu-generated/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.0/#Distribution.licence">licence</a>.
In those legislative contexts it is advised to translate this encouragement in appropriate metadata guidelines for the targeted publishers.
For instance, such guidelines could state that one must use a set of rights to document the reuse conditions.


<p></p>
Since legal information may vary per distribution or service, DCAT-AP has adopted from its conception, the strategy to <b>only</b> express legal information at the most concrete level of sharing, i.e. Distribution or Data Service.
Suppose licensing information is also given on the Dataset level, there is a possibility that this is in conflict with licensing information on the Distribution, in which case it cannot be established which licence takes precedence.
By this strategy, the need for a conflict resolution between legal information at the level of a Dataset (or Dataset Series) and its associated Distributions or Data Services is avoided.


<p></p>
Despite the above examples provided here are a perfect fit for those that are in scope of 'Open Data', they apply also for data that is beyond the scope of 'Open Data'.
E.g. the Data Governance Act requires to provide sufficient legal reuse information such as the fees that apply.

  <h2>Agent Roles</h2>


<p>
The first version of DCAT Application Profile [[vocab-dcat-1]] had a single property to relate an Agent (typically, an organisation) to a Dataset.
The only such ‘agent role’ that could be expressed in that version of the profile is through the property <a href="#Dataset.publisher">publisher</a>, defined as “An entity responsible for making the dataset available”.
A second property is available in that DCAT recommendation [[vocab-dcat-1]], <a href="#Dataset.contactpoint">contact point</a>, defined as “Link a dataset to relevant contact information which is provided using <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6350.html">vCard</a>”, but this is not an agent role as the value of this property is contact data, rather than a representation of the organisation as such.
In specific cases, for example in exchanging data among domain-specific portals, it may be useful to express other, more specific agent roles.
In such cases, extensions to DCAT-AP may be defined using additional properties with more specific meanings.
</p><p>
Two possible approaches have been discussed, particular in the context of the development of the domain-specific GeoDCAT Application Profile [[geodcat-ap]].
The first possible approach is based on the use of a predicate vocabulary that provides a set of properties that represent additional types of relationships between Datasets and Agents.
For example, properties could be defined, such as foo:owner, foo:curator or foo:responsibleParty, in addition to the use of existing well-known properties, such as dct:creator and dct:rightsHolder.
A possible source for such additional properties is the Roles Named Authority List  maintained by the Publications Office of the EU.
Other domain-specific sources for additional properties are the <a href="https://knowledge-base.inspire.ec.europa.eu/index_en">INSPIRE</a> Responsible Party roles ,<a href="https://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/relaterm.html">the Library of Congress’ MARC relators</a> and <a href="https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-metadata-schema-v44-recommended-and-optional-properties#:~:text=Foo%20Data%20Center-,7.a%20contributorType,-Occurrence%3A%201">DataCite’s contributor types</a>.
To enable the use of such properties, they must be defined as RDF properties with URIs in a well-managed namespace. 
</p><p>
A second approach is based on the use of W3C’s PROV ontology [[prov-o]]  which provides a powerful mechanism to express a set of classes, properties, and restrictions that can be used to represent and interchange provenance information generated in different systems and under different contexts. In the context of work on GeoDCAT-AP, a PROV-conformant solution for expressing agent roles was agreed . This solution uses prov:qualifiedAttribution in combination with a dct:type assertion pointing to the code list for Responsible Party Role in the <a href="https://knowledge-base.inspire.ec.europa.eu/index_en">INSPIRE</a> registry. To enable the use of such types, they must be defined with URIs in a well-managed namespace. 
</p><p>
Based on the experience gained with the use of domain-specific extensions for additional ‘agent roles’ in the exchange of information about Datasets and on the requests of implementors and stakeholders, the DCAT Application Profile release 2.0.0  is extended with additional roles as proposed by DCAT Version 2 [[vocab-dcat-2]] that have proven to be useful across domains. Precisely, properties <a href="#Dataset.creator">creator</a>, <a href="#Dataset.qualifiedattribution">qualified attribution</a> and <a href="#Dataset.qualifiedrelation">qualified relation</a> have been added to <a href="#Dataset">Dataset</a> class to further facilitate relationships between datasets and agents. 
</p><p>
In the most recent DCAT Version 3 [[vocab-dcat-3]] a dedicated <a href="https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/dcat/#qualified-forms">section on the relationship with Agents</a> is provided.
The DCAT-AP guidelines for Agents Roles are conformant to this.
</p><p>
It should be noted that, even if a more expressive approach is used in a particular implementation, the provision of information using dct:publisher for the Catalogue is still mandatory under the rules laid down in the Conformance Statement in section [[[#conformance]]], while the provision of information using dct:publisher is strongly recommended for Dataset. The provision of such information using dct:publisher will ensure interoperability with implementations that use the basic approach of DCAT-AP.

<h2>Accessibility and Multilingual Aspects</h2>

<p>
Accessibility in the context of this Application Profile is limited to information about the technical format of distributions of datasets. The properties dcat:mediaType and dct:format provide information that can be used to determine what software can be deployed to process the data. The accessibility of the data within the datasets needs to be taken care of by the software that processes the data and is outside of the scope of this Application Profile. 
</p><p>
Multilingual aspects related to this Application Profile concern all properties whose contents are expressed as strings (i.e. rdfs:Literal) with human-readable text. Wherever such properties are used, the string values are of one of two types:
<ul>
<li>The string is free text. Examples are descriptions and labels. Such text may be translated into several languages.</li>
<li>The string is an appellation of a ‘named entity’. Examples are names of organisations or persons. These names may have parallel versions in other languages but those versions don’t need to be literal translations.</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
Wherever values of properties are expressed with either type of string, the property can be repeated with translations in the case of free text and with parallel versions in case of named entities. For free text, e.g. in the cases of titles, descriptions and keywords, the language tag is mandatory. 
</p><p>
Language tags to be used with rdfs:Literal are defined by BCP47 [[rfc5646]], which allows the use of the "t" extension for text transformations defined in RFC6497 [[rfc6497]] with the field "t0"  indicating a machine translation.
</p><p>
A language tag will look like: "en-t-es-t0-abcd", which conveys the information that the string is in English, translated from Spanish by machine translation using a tool named "abcd". 
</p><p>
For named entities, the language tag is optional and should only be provided if the parallel version of the name is strictly associated with a particular language. For example, the name ‘European Union’ has parallel versions in all official languages of the union, while a name like ‘W3C’ is not associated with a particular language and has no parallel versions.
</p><p>
For linking to different language versions of associated web pages (e.g. landing pages) or documentation, a content negotiation  mechanism may be used whereby different content is served based on the Accept-Languages indicated by the browser. Using such a mechanism, the link to the page or document can resolve to different language versions of the page or document.
</p><p>
All the occurrences of the property dct:language, which can be repeated if the metadata is provided in multiple languages, MUST have a URI [[rfc3986]] as their object, not a literal string from the ISO 639 code list.
</p><p>
How multilingual information is handled in systems, for example in indexing and user interfaces, is outside of the scope of this Application Profile.

  <section id="UsageGuidelines" class="informative">
<h2>General usage guidelines</h2>
<h3>Usage guide on Datasets, Distributions and Data Services</h3>
<p>
The introduction of Data Services as first class citizens in DCAT 2.0 raised questions about the usage of Data Services and Distributions. This section provides a guideline for publishers what to consider as a Distribution and what as a Data Service.
</p><p>

A first distinction between distributions and data services is their dependency on a dataset for their existence. A distribution cannot exist without its dataset. It is a specific representation of a dataset (cfr definition W3C <a href="https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/dcat/#Class:Distribution">Distribution</a>). Whereas a data service is an entity in its own right. It provides access to datasets or it provides data processing functions. The independence also holds between the distributions of a dataset, and the data service which provides access to that dataset. The distributions are not required to be the result of the data service operations. However, they may.

</p><p>
Many of the properties of distributions are file oriented (downloadURL, format, byte size, checksum, modification date, ...). The relevance of this information is reduced for data services, related information is present in a very different form and thus under different terminology. For instance, data services do and can provide format transformations, language transformations and schema transformations on request. Also the handling of trust is different. While tampering of downloadable content is detected by e.g. checksums, data services create often a trusted channel using security measures such as authentication and encryption. This reduces the need for additional trust checks on the data.

</p><p>
The difference between downloading a file or accessing the data through a service have resulted in the following guidelines:
<ul>
    <li>Datasets are the conceptual entity denoting a collection of data.</li>
    <li>Distributions are specific representations of a dataset, described with the intent to facilitate the delivery of the data as file to a reuser. The access URL (preferably download URL) will provide a simple way to obtain (download) the content of the dataset in the representation specified by the distribution. The obtained (downloaded) content is fully determined by the publisher of the distribution. Only after obtaining the data the (re)user can change the data according to its needs.</li>
    <li>Anything that has not the intent to provide a downloadable representation of a dataset is a data service. Data services offer smarter, more interactive ways to the data.</li>
</ul>

</p><p>
Orthogonal to the nature clarification of distributions and data services, there might be need for a granularity clarification between datasets and distributions. Commonly, at first sight, it is expected that all distributions of a dataset are identical in content, only differing in the representation of the data. But when considering dataset series, this interpretation seems not valid anymore. In the upcoming release of DCAT 3.0, dataset series and dataset versioning are addressed. Implementors are advised to already take this proposal into account when creating guidelines for distributions. Note that this is less an issue between datasets and data services as both are independent entities. Data services usually address the granularity by providing the necessary query interface language so that the user can get the data according its needs.

</p><p>
These guidelines will be able to capture many access patterns, corresponding to most users' expectations. However there might be cases that are more vague. In that case the DCAT(-AP) community can be questioned for a recommended approach.
</p>


<h3>Usage guide on Dataset Series</h3>
Dataset Series can be considered as message from the publisher that the data of a dataset evolves according to one or more dimensions and that this evolution is available via a collection of independent, yet closely related, datasets.
<p/>
The need for sharing this grouping explicitly is strongly use case dependent, and therefore as this will require additional metadata management effort by the publisher, the use of Dataset Series is optional.
It should fit the objectives.
For instance, if a publisher is sharing an active updated dataset accessible via an API, that provides current as historic data, then it is not mandatory to created metadata records for each snapshot per year. Only if these snapshots are created intentionally and the publisher wants to share the life cycle of them with the public, then Dataset Series come into the picture.
<p/>
In order to harmonise the use of Dataset Series, the following guidelines are to be considered:
<ul>
<li>To introduce a Dataset Series only if the publisher has the intent to manage a collection of datasets. Dataset Series with a single dataset in the collection should be avoided.
</li>
<li>Dataset Series without a dataset in the collection should be avoided. In that case, publishers should ensure that the metadata, in particular, the life cycle metadata is up to date. 
For instance, if dataset get retracted and as consequence the collection becomes empty, then publishers should consider to retract also the Dataset Series.
In case, publishers use persistent identifiers, then this should be reflected in the status of the Dataset Series.
</li>
<li>A Dataset Series is an conceptual dataset without distributions.
When interpreting a Dataset Series as a Dataset, then it is expected that the directly associated Distributions contain the data that is the union of all Datasets in the collection. 
But the presence of these Distributions raise semantical conflicts such as whether the property of the Dataset Series <code>frequency</code> refers to the update frequency of the associated Distributions or the update frequency of the collection. To avoid these semantical conflicts, it is recommended not to associate distributions with a Dataset Series.
</li>
<li>The members of a Dataset Series should be described in such a way that without the knowledge of the Dataset Series, the metadata is interpreted correctly. The existence of a dataset should not be based on the membership in a Dataset Series. The interpretation of a member with its associated Distributions and Data Services is conform the above guidelines.
</li>
<li>Whenever a Data Service is providing access to all the data of a Dataset Series, i.e. the union of all datasets in the collection of the Dataset Series, 
    then the Data Service may refer to the Dataset Series using <a href="#DataService.servesdataset">serves dataset</a>. 
    The ensures that whenever in the future the Dataset Series is extended with new Datasets the Data Service description does not need to be adapted.
    In that case the Dataset Series should also be considered as a DCAT-AP Dataset.
</li>      
<li>Keep the usage simple. Complex nesting such as Dataset Series being a member of Dataset Series, or Dataset belonging to multiple Dataset Series are to be handled with care. 
While from a data knowledge graph these nestings are feasible and not so problematic, it must be realised that these complicate the presentation on a webpage. 
Since data portal representations are the main communication from metadata owners to potential data consumers and there is no clear expectations
on how to present the members of a Dataset Series in a UI (e.g. because ordering is not imposed), DCAT-AP users may not expect from other portals which harvest and process their Dataset Series, that these are more than a collection of Datasets.
Any interpretation, such as the collection is ordered, or grouped according to time or any wellknown dimension, is a specific expectation beyond the agreemenents made in DCAT-AP. 
</li>
<li>Conceptually, a Dataset Series is a special kind of Dataset. It is recommended to apply the same metadata quality of Datasets to Dataset Series (see [[[#quick-reference]]] ). The dedicated usage guidelines for Dataset Series and the Dataset members of a Dataset Series take priority over the generic DCAT-AP Dataset guidelines.
</li>
</ul>

<p/>
In general it is expected that the members of Dataset Series are strongly connected. 
However, there are no common criteria or rules how this connection could be determined.
Usually, the shared characteristics are expressed as a data domain, e.g. the population of bees, and some evolution in space and time, e.g. in Greece for the period of 2019-2023, and published by a single publisher.
Nevertheless, other characteristics could give raise to the creation of a Dataset Series.
<p/>
The DCAT-AP working group has investigated to find and express unique characteristics of Datasets that are members of a Dataset Series. 
Over time, during the exchanges it became clear that today no consensus exists on restricting the use of Dataset Series to a more limited use.
Therefore the DCAT-AP working group has decided to retract the notion of a Dataset Member of a Dataset Series (a subclass of DCAT-AP Datasets). 
Profile builders may reintroduce this notion when they want to express specific constraints for that usage scope.
<p/>
In case the connection is very strong or the result of an automated process, versioning terminology is a natural way to express the connection between the Datasets in the Dataset Series collection.
For guidelines on expressing versioning information in DCAT-AP, consult the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/dcat/#version-history">DCAT guidelines on versioning</a>.
As versioning is not always the most appropriate terminology, DCAT introduces properties <a href="https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/dcat/#ex-dataset-series-containment">(e.g. next, previous, inSeries, last, etc.)</a> to interconnect the Dataset Series with its members and among the members themselves. 
It is recommended to use always these properties in combination with Dataset Series, and versioning when appropriate.
<p/>
The membership in a Dataset Series may influence the (descriptive) metadata to highlight differences from other Datasets in the collection. 
For instance, a usual adaption is the addition of the release data in the title.

<h2>High Value Datasets</h2>

<p>
In light of the growing importance of data, the European Commission has adopted an <href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32023R0138">implementing regulation</a> focused on high-value datasets on 21 December 2022 [[HVD]]. 
The ambition of the High-Value Datasets implementing regulation (HVD IR) is to improve the quality, the accessibility and use of a selective number of core datasets within the public sector.
To achieve this the HVD IR sets, among others, requirements on the metadata associated with the disclosed datasets.
These requirements can be expressed as additional constraints and usage notes on DCAT-AP and are collected in an annex dedicated to the implementation of the HVD IR [[DCAT-AP-HVD]].
</p>

  <section class="informative">
  <h2>Support for implementation</h2>

Implementing the DCAT-AP data specification in a data exchange between two systems raises also technical questions.
<p/>

<h4>JSON-LD context file</h4>

One common technical question is the format in which the data is being exchanged. 
For DCAT-AP conformance, it is not mandatory that this happens in a RDF serialisation, but the exchanged format SHOULD be unambiguously be transformable into RDF.
For the format JSON, a popular format to exchange data between systems, DCAT-AP provides a <a href="./context/dcat-ap.jsonld">JSON-LD context file</a>. 
JSON-LD is a W3C Recommendation [[[json-ld11]]] that provided a standard approach to interpret JSON structures as RDF.
The provided JSON-LD context file can be used by implementers to base their data exchange upon, and so create a DCAT-AP conformant data exchange.
This JSON-LD context is not normative, i.e. other JSON-LD contexts are allowed to create a a conformant DCAT-AP data exchange.
<p/>
The JSON-LD context file downloadable <a href="./context/dcat-ap.jsonld">here</a>.

<p/>
<h4>Identifiers</h4>
For implementers, the requirement to being able to exchange data as RDF impacts the design of the exchange format and the data management. 
One aspect, the use of identifiers,  needs special attention as it influences the interpretation by others. 
DCAT-AP is used mostly in a harvesting network: where one catalogue harvests from other. 
By this process, the DCAT-AP metadata descriptions spread through the harvesting network. 
In contrast to "classical" data exchange patterns where by default identifiers are locally scoped to the exchange context, the RDF format implicitly assumes global, public accessible identifiers (URIs).
Harvesting enforces the latter. 
More on this identifier challenge and possible solution approaches are documented in the <a href="https://github.com/SEMICeu/DCAT-AP/blob/2.x.y-draft/releases/2.x.y/usageguide-identifiers.md">the guidelines on identifier management in DCAT-AP</a>.


<p/>
<h4>Validation</h4>
To verify if the data exchange is (technically) conformant to DCAT-AP, the exchanged data can be validated using the provided SHACL shapes. 
SHACL is a W3C Recommendation to express constraints on a RDF knowledge graph. 
The provided SHACL shapes allow to check whether an DCAT-AP catalogue expressed in a RDF serialization is valid.
As it should be possible for DCAT-AP conformance to transform the data exchange in RDF, these SHACL shapes can be used in any data exchange context.
However, likewise the use of the JSON-LD context, the provided SHACL shapes provide only a start point for implementers. 
<p/>
The shapes that can be derived from the DCAT-AP specification have the following usage limitations.
Shapes may check situations that never occur in the implemented data exchange and result in messages that confuse publishers, or they are too general and more detailed checks should be implemented. 
For example, the nature of a licence is recommended by DCAT-AP, but most DCAT-AP exchanges assume that based on the URI of the licence this information is known. 
Thus the check that a licence should have a licence type is considered often not relevant for the individual publishers. 
However they might support catalogue maintainers to guide individual publishers to use well-documented licence URIs.
The case that a title cannot be an empty string and must have a value in a specific language are examples of more detailed constraints that are not present in the provided DCAT-AP SHACL shapes.
<p/>
More on the validation and the provided SHACL shapes can be found in section [[[#validation-of-dcat-ap]]].

<p/>








</section>

  <section class="informative">
  <h2>Validation of DCAT-AP</h2>

<p>
To support the check whether or not a catalogue satisfies the expressed constraints in this Application Profile, the constraints in this specification are expressed using SHACL [[shacl]].
Each constraint in this specification that could be converted into a SHACL expression has been included.
As such this collection of SHACL expressions that can be used to build a validation check for a data exchange between two systems. 
A typical use case is the harvesting of one catalogue into another.
</p><p>
It is up to the implementers of the data exchange to define the validation they expect.
Each data exchange happens within a context, and that context is beyond the SHACL expressions here.
</p><p>
For instance, it might be known that the exchanged data does not contain the details of the organisations, as they are all uniquely identified by a deferenceable URI.
In such case, the rules regarding the check of the mandatory existence of a name for each organisation is probably not relevant. 
A strict execution of the DCAT-AP SHACL expressions will raise errors, although the data is available through a different channel.
In this example, it is valid to not include this check in this validation step. 
</p><p>
The example illustrates that in order to get the right user experience of a validation process, one has to consider what is actually transferred between the systems.
And use the constraints that are in scope of the data exchange.
To assist this process the SHACL expressions are grouped in distinct files, matching already typical validation setups.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="./html/shacl/shapes.ttl">shapes.ttl</a>: constraints concerning existence, domain and literal range, and cardinalities. </li>
    <li><a href="./html/shacl/range.ttl">range.ttl</a>: constraints concerning object range. </li>
    <li><a href="./html/shacl/mdr-vocabularies.shape.ttl">mdr-vocabularies.shape.ttl</a>: constraints concerning the usage of controlled vocabularies.</li>
</ul>

The first file provides for each class mentioned in DCAT-AP, and having additional properties defined, a template with the corresponding constraints. 
Class membership constraints are not present in the first file. 
These are collected in the second file.

<ul>
   <li><a href="./html/shacl/shapes_recommended.ttl">shapes_recommended.ttl</a>: constraints concerning existence of recommended properties.</li>
</ul>

In order to validate a catalogue additional data might be required to import into the validator, such as the controlled vocabularies. These have to be retrieved from the appropriate places. As support, the following files express the imports (not transitive) according to the SHACL specification, which can be loaded into the Interoperable Europe Testbed.

<ul>
    <li><a href="./html/shacl/imports.ttl">imports.ttl</a>: imports the vocabulary knowledge.</li>
    <li><a href="./html/shacl/mdr_imports.ttl">mdr_imports.ttl</a>: imports the recommended codelists.</li>
</ul>

The shacl files are configured in this instance of the Interoperable Europe testbed: <a href="https://www.itb.ec.europa.eu/shacl/dcat-ap/upload">https://www.itb.ec.europa.eu/shacl/dcat-ap/upload</a>. More information about the configured validation profiles is <a href="https://github.com/ISAITB/validator-resources-dcat-ap">https://github.com/ISAITB/validator-resources-dcat-ap</a>.

<p/>
In addition to these SHACL shapes extending the approach from DCAT-AP 2.x, the constraints are also provided in a new design where each constraint has got a unique identifier.
This new shape is addressing the request for having a design in which DCAT-AP implementers could cherry pick the constraints they want.
The shape is downloadable <a href="./shacl/dcat-ap-SHACL.ttl">here</a>.

  <section class="informative">
<h2>Example Dataset Series</h2>

<p>This section describes the use of Dataset Series via examples.
All examples are fictitious and are created to facilitate the understanding of Dataset Series.
This section complements the usage explained in section <a href="https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/dcat/#dataset-series">Dataset series</a> in DCAT 3 [[vocab-dcat-3]], because it 
illustrates the decision making process when switching from publishing a single Dataset to a Dataset Series.
</p>

<p>Consider the dataset 'Bee population in Greece" published by the Greek Environment Agency.
Users can download the data as a CSV or an RDF file.</p>

<div class="h3 examples" id="example-bee-population">Example 1 - Bee population dataset</div>

<p>To see the evolution in the bee population, the Greek Environment Agency publishes an update each year.
This update can be reflected in the DCAT-AP description in various ways.</p>

<p>The first option is to update and renew the metadata each update.
For instance, the temporal coverage changes from the period "2020 - 2022" to "2020 - 2023".</p>

<p>This solution has as benefit that new information is shared with a minimal effort of publisher.
However, this approach removes the previous state of affairs from the metadata and also does not reflect the aggregation and publishing effort for the dataset in the metadata.
In some cases this is a desired outcome.</p>

<p>The alternative option is the creation of a new dataset description.
Often this choice is a voluntary decision, however it might be enforced by legislation. 
Legislation can impose to share an audited dataset reflecting the state of affairs on a reference date.</p>

<p>The creation of new dataset also impacts the metadata, as the generic title "Bee population" cannot be maintained for both.
A publisher must perform a minimal disambiguation effort to make the two datasets distinct.</p>

<div class="h3 examples" id="example-bee-population-2022-2023">Example 2 - Bee population datasets for 2022 and 2023</div>

<p>Independent of the metadata descriptions, a core decision to take is whether the dataset <code>BeePopulation2022</code> is also contained in the dataset <code>BeePopulation2023</code>. 
Either case is valuable and seen in practice.</p>

<p>However, without expressing any relationships between the datasets this approach has a major drawback: a search on the catalogue for bee population will result in several variants of the same dataset.
The catalogue user is not provided with any guidance to select the most recent or most appropriate one.
To address that use case, Dataset Series come into the picture.
Dataset Series offer a structured approach to order or organise the datasets by the publisher for the catalogue user.</p>

<p>To support the data portal users, the Greek Environment Agency starts managing a Dataset Series <code>BeePopulation</code>.</p>

<div class="h3 examples" id="example-bee-population-dataset-series">Example 3 - Bee population datasets series</div>

<p>As the dataset <code>BeePopulation2023</code> is more recent than <code>BeePopulation2022</code>, a navigation ordering is added.</p>

<div class="h3 examples" id="example-bee-population-dataset-series-ordered">Example 4 - Bee population datasets series ordered</div>

<p>In most cases, the navigation is a single chain sequence, although tree organised structures are not prohibited.</p>

<p>Similarly as the introduction of a new dataset description, the introduction of a Dataset Series impacts the metadata of the involved datasets.</p>

<p>For instance the notion of the update frequency becomes more precise.
In case of a single dataset description, the statement, in the example below, means that the dataset is updated each year.</p>

<div class="h3 examples" id="example-bee-population-dataset-frequency">Example 5 - Bee population dataset frequency</div>

<p>So each year the actual data to which this dataset provides access to changes, and the most recent information can be found via this metadata.</p>

<p>However; when the publisher will introduce a new dataset description each year, the update frequency of an existing dataset is none. Namely it will not be updated. 
Without a Dataset Series notion the information of the yearly update is lost.</p>

<div class="h3 examples" id="example-bee-population-dataset-series-frequency">Example 6 - Bee population dataset series frequency</div>

<p>Users expect that metadata of Dataset Series is coherent with the collection of datasets it refers to. 
Up to 2022, the Greek Environment Agency only had the ability to provide the information for the region of Thessaloniki, and shared that via the spatial coverage.</p>

<div class="h3 examples" id="example-bee-population-dataset-series-spatial-thessaloniki">Example 7 - Bee population dataset series about Thessaloniki</div>

<p>From 2023 onwards, data for the region of Athens is also provided. As a consequence, not only the spatial coverage of the new dataset <code>BeePopulation2023</code> will reflect that, but also the one of the Dataset Series.
Namely the geographical coverage of a dataset series will cover the union of all places of each dataset associated with the Dataset Series.</p>

<p>A similar coherency concern applies to the temporal coverage of datasets.
Publisher are advised to verify the properties title and description to match any reference to temporal and geographical coverage information with the properties.</p>

<p>The metadata descriptions of a Dataset Series provide insight in how this collection of datasets evolves.
The release date of the Dataset Series <code>BeePopulation</code> correspond to the moment the collection has been issued for the first time.
In many cases this moment corresponds to the earliest release date of the dataset in the collection.
In the example, the Dataset <code>BeePopulation2022</code> was first issued on <code>2022-04-01</code> while shortly after, the Dataset Series was created.</p>

<div class="h3 examples" id="example-bee-population-dataset-series-issued">Example 9 - Bee population dataset series issuing</div>

<p>This relationship between the issuing date and the oldest dataset in the collection can reduce over time.
The Greek Environment Agency and the National History Archives start to collaborate on the use and production of honey.
That project results in new datasets on bee populations predating 2022. 
To make that information visible, the Dataset Series collection is updated with these historic datasets.</p>

<div class="h3 examples" id="example-bee-population-dataset-series-gea-nha">Example 10 - Bee population dataset series with National History Archive</div>

<p>The modification date of the Dataset Series is the moment the collection has changed. 
The addition of the historic datasets changes the collection, and thus the modification date of the Dataset Series is set to <code>2023-06-01</code>.</p>

<div class="h3 examples" id="example-bee-population-dataset-series-modified">Example 11 - Bee population dataset series with modification date</div>

<p>To make the datasets easier to use, the Greek Environment Agency introduces a new API platform. Via this API platform the datasets are not only downloadable in tabular format, but also in the international Biodiversity JSON format.</p>

<div class="h3 examples" id="example-bee-population-dataset-series-api">Example 11 - Bee population available in new format</div>

As such the use of a new API platform has not changed the data denoted by the dataset <code>BeePopulation2023</code>, and so it is not necessary to adapt the modification date of the dataset.
Similarly adding or removing distributions to a dataset did not affected the membership of dataset <code>BeePopulation2023</code> in the Dataset Series. 
And thus the modification date of the Dataset Series is not adapted.

<p/>
To support the users even more, the API platform is extended with a possibility to get life counts of the bee population.
This means that there is a dataset which data is updated very frequently, eg. every second.
In that case providing a modification date for the dataset becomes a technical challenge, but also it reduces it value.
Namely one gets the data at query time.</p>

<div class="h3 examples" id="example-bee-population-dataset-series-life-count">Example 12 - Bee population dataset series API life count</div>

All this can be combined in one dataset series about the Bee population. Doing so, the Bee population dataset series becomes 
less a structured sequence of yearly snapshots of the Bee population data, but more a collection of datasets around the same topic.
Likewise DCAT, DCAT-AP does not limit the use of dataset series to a strict interpretation. Making this approach acceptable. 
Nevertheless users usually expect that the datasets of a Dataset Series are strongly related, and the notion of a series or sequence is somehow present in the collection.
Diverging too far from this interpretation is not recommended.
The alternative for dataset series for grouping datasets are catalogues. 
<p/>
Thus to conclude the example of maintaining a Dataset Series, the Greek Environment Agency has created a Dataset Series about the Bee population in Greece.
It contains the dataset with actual life data, the yearly snapshots for 2023 and 2022 and also the historic data of 2000 maintained by the National History Archives.

  <section class="informative">
  <h2>Inverse properties</h2>

The W3C DCAT specification introduces for some relationships two properties which are each other's inverse. 
In general, this may lead to situations that data exchanges based on different DCAT profiles require reasoning to align. 

<p/>
To harmonise the exchange of DCAT based data and reduce the need for inference engines, 
W3C DCAT imposes <a href="https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/dcat/#inverse-properties">implementation guidelines</a> expressing a preference in use. 
The guidelines state which property must be used while the other, called the inverse,  may be used.
In a proper DCAT profile the inverse property cannot be used to replace completely the property. 

<p/>
In line with these guidelines with the objective to reduce the burden of implementers DCAT-AP will follow the W3C guidelines in a more strict way.
When a property is subject to this W3C guideline then DCAT-AP will include only the use of this property and not the inverse.
Implementers are still free to use the inverse to optimise their data management. 
<p/>
As note to this discussion: when exchanging DCAT as an RDF graph the impact of the directionality is reduced because
<ul>
<li> RDF statements are non-ordered and grouping according to directionality is more for human readibility than technically enforced. 
</li>
<li> SPARQL allows to query in any direction simply by switching the subject and object variables.
</ul>

<h2>Quick Reference of Classes and Properties</h2>

This section provides a condensed tabular overview of the mentioned classes and properties in this specification.
The properties are grouped under headings <it>mandatory, recommended, optional</it> and <it>deprecated</it>. These terms have the following meaning.
<ul>
<li>Mandatory property: a receiver MUST be able to process the information for that property; a sender MUST provide the information for that property.</li>
<li>Recommended property: a receiver MUST be able to process the information for that property; a sender SHOULD provide the information for that property if it is available.</li>
<li>Optional property: a receiver MUST be able to process the information for that property; a sender MAY provide the information for that property but is not obliged to do so.</li>
<li>Deprecated property: a receiver SHOULD be able to process information about instances of that property; a sender SHOULD NOT provide the information about instances of that property.</li>
